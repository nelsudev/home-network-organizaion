# Documentation Guidelines

This repository contains resources for organizing a home network. Use the following guidelines when contributing documentation within this repository:

- Focus on clear, concise explanations of networking concepts tailored for home environments.
- Use Markdown headings to structure content logically (e.g., Overview, Hardware Inventory, Network Topology, Security Practices, Maintenance Tasks).
- Prefer bullet lists or tables for device inventories and configuration summaries.
- When describing procedures, provide step-by-step instructions and note any prerequisites.
- Include examples or diagrams (as Markdown image links) whenever they improve understanding of network layouts or workflows.
- Keep terminology consistent across documents (e.g., "router", "access point", "switch", "NAS").
- Update cross-references when adding or renaming files so readers can easily navigate related topics.

These conventions apply to all documentation files within this repository unless superseded by more specific instructions in nested directories.
